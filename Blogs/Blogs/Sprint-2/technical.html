    <h5><center>What is the Difference Between Border, Margin and Padding</center></h5>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p><center>Margin, border and Padding in coding refer to the space between elements in a design. Margin, refers to the space between the border of a design and the next element of your design.<br> The padding is the inside space of the design, between the border and the content. The easiest way to understand this is to see it in a picture.</center></p>

    <img src="../../../Images/examples.jpg" alt="examples" class=img>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p><center>As you can see in the first picture, the margin gives us space between two objects,<br> the border provides and outline of the object and the padding provides space between the border and the content that is inside the object.<br> The second image shows the Margin and padding when two objects are involved.</center></p>

    <h6><center>How to Use Margins, borders and Padding in CSS</center></h6>
   <div class="paragraph">
    <p><center>To add a margin to an element, four margins need to be declared, representing each side of the element. <br>These would be Margin-top, Margin-right, Margin-bottom and margin left. <br>The margin property allows for you to set all the margins to one number, however, if you wanted to have each margin have a seperate length or percentage you can set them individually. <br>To do this you would use the code "margin: 20x 24x 35x 100x;" with x representing which unit of measurement you want to use.<br> The order goes around your object clockwise. Padding uses the same basic code as margins, you just have to replace the word margin with padding. <br>Borders also use a basic code and can be stylised easily too.<br> Below I have included some screenshots of me playing around with these commands in the form of some plain boxes on my blogs homepage.</center></p>

    <p><center>In these first images, I have just created a simple box with standard attributes for the margin and padding, and a simple border</center></p>

    <div class="paragraph">
    <p><center>I then added a second box so I could play around with the margins. I also gave the second box a different style of border.</center></p>
