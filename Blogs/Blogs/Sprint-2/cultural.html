    <div class="paragraph">
        <p><center>I will make sure that I use my time wisely and try to not get distracted. I will also try to stick as close to the time box suggestions as possible so I manage my time between tasks properly, and dont get caught up in one thing for too long, which can happen to me quite easily. I will also make sure I can have my weekly catch up with my facilitator so I can talk about whether or not I am doing ok.</center></p>
