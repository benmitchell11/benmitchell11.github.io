    <h5><center>What is Neuroplasticity</center></h5>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p><center>Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to adapt. If we learn something new, we then create connections between our neurons, and our brain is then rewired to adapt to new circumstances. It is through this process that we learn to play an instrument or to speak a new language, among other things. There are two main types of neuroplasticity. the first of these is structural neuroplasticity, which is where the strength of the connections between neurons change, and functional neuroplasticity, where there is permanent changes in synapses due to learning and development. Neuroplasticity can be increased by both doing things, and by thinking about doing that same thing. This is useful for coding, as we can strengthen our skills by thinking about how we would write the code before actually writing it down.</center></p>

    <h6><center>What is a Growth Mindest.</center></h6>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p><center>Growth mindset refers to the mindset that our intelligence and talents can grow and be developed, in contrast to what is called a fixed mindset, where it is believed that these things are just fixed traits dependent on the individual. The idea is that whilst developing in a learning sense, if as children we are constantly praised and told we are smart or gifted for doing something well, or the opposite for something bad, that this will influence an individual to have a fixed mindset. It was pretty eye opening to research this topic, as I spent a lot of time with a fixed mindset, believing that I was always just doing the best that I could do with my abilities as an individual, and was never really thinking about how I could get better. This has since changed whilst learning this course, however there are still times where I feel this way. Growth mindset is important in my learning journey at dev academy, because it is important to remember that coding isnt just a skill that we automatically have, and just because we cant do something the first time we try it, doesnt mean that we cant learn and adapt and be able to do it after more research and practice.
