    <h5><center>Getting Blocked on  Simple Problem.</center></h5>
    <p><center>One small problem I got blocked on was with the formatting of how I had written my code whilst testing on repl.it. I had written my code to how I thought that it should be working, and even looking at the solution page it appeared that I had written my code write, however it was not working when I clicked play. I kept reading the error message over and over again, until I realised that there was a tiny mistake, in the form of having part of my code within brackets when it did not need to be there. Throughout the process I felt rather frustrated and confused as I was sure I had done everything right. From this I learned that it is important to always keep an eye out for the simplest and smallest mistakes, and to always pay close attention to the error messages you get as they can often help show exactly where the problem is.</center></p>
    <h6><center>Solving a Problem in an Elegant way.</center></h6>
    <p><center>One problem I feel I did well in solving was with my initial confusion with some of the challenges on repl.it. I feel like I solved this well with the use of googling, as I was able to figure out the parts that were confusing me and able to complete the challenges. At first I was a bit worried as I thought I wouldnt be able to complete the tasks, however I was able to quickly find resources to help me figure out what I needed to. From this I learned that one of the best parts about working with computers is we always have access to the answers we need at our fingertips.</center></p>
    <h7><center>Confidence with problem soliving techniques</center></h7>
    <p><center>I feel quite confident with most of the problem solving techniques we researched in this weeks sprint. I found the pseudocoding quite useful, as it helps to be able to remember exactly what the code you are writing is supposed to be doing. The rubber ducky method is also quite useful, as it is sometimes easy to get caught up in the technical lingo, and sometimes explaining things as simply as possible can help us figure out what needs to be done. As I said earlier, the googling method is great too, as we have access to a whole bunch of different resources and other people who can help with the problems we are currently facing. The two processes I struggle with most would be the asking peers and asking coaches, as my introverted nature often makes this a difficult task.</center></p>
