    <h5><center>Strengths and limitations</center></h5>
    <div class="paragraph">
    <p><center>I'd say that my strengths are creativity, adaptability, willingness to learn and determination. I love to create things and work on personal projects,<br> and enjoy learning new things. Despite a few setbacks in life I always make sure I give everything I can, and used this determination to pass my degree at university, and am currently using it to tackle web development too. <br>

        My main limmitation is probably that I'm quite introverted. I often struggle with talking to people I dont know very well, and It sometimes causes me to suffer, as I do things like not ask questions because I feel like im being a pain. <br> It also makes writing things like my reflections and these blog posts hard, as I never really know what to say, and dont often share my personal thoughts and beliefs.

        <h6><center>A time working with a group that got tense</center></h6>
        <div class="paragraph">
        <p><center>At university we would often have to work with groups of people from our tutorials, which could often create problems as not everyone was on the same schedule, so trying to work together well could be quite difficult,<br> and it would sometimes seem like you were doing more work than others. The best way I found to deal with this was just communicating with each other properly, and finding out a way to work that suited everyone. <br>It was also good to tell people about any reason you might not be able to do a specific task, and also finding out what everyones strengths were so you could divide up the work in a way that worked best for everyone involved.</center></p>

</center></h7>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><center>Growing up in the internet age has definately effected the way I view the world, and had a great impact on my values and identity.<br> Being able to be so easily connected to people and things happening all over the world has opened my eyes to many things, both good and bad. <br> Being connected to people of all kinds of different backgrounds and identities has taught me the importance of acceptance and kindness. </center></p>
