    <h5><center>What is the difference between EQ and IQ.</center></h5>
    <p><center>To understand the difference, we must first understand what these two terms mean. IQ refers to an individuals Intelligence Quotient. It is the more commonly known of the 2, and in simple terms measures how smart an individual is, by giving an individual a score from taking a standardized test designed to measure their intelligence. EQ stands for Emotional Quotient, and refers to an individuals ability to evaluate and contol their own, as well as others, emotions. This means that the major difference between the two is one is more useful in an academic sense, whilst the other would be more useful for situations in everyday life. A way to look at this is that a high IQ will get you through school, where as a high EQ will get you through life.</center></p>
    <h6><center>Why EQ is important and how it is relevant to me</center></h6>
    <p><center>EQ, or emotional intelligence, is important because it effects how we deal with our everyday lives. It effects how we interact with other people, and how we react to situations happening around us. Because of this, we can achieve higher productivity in the workplace by using the fundamental principles of emotional intelligence. This makes it an important concept for me personally, as well as programmers as a whole, because if we apply these principles to the way that we work, we can achieve excellence and work more efficiently. Increasing your EQ as a leader can also reinforce the rest of your workplace, and a higher EQ can lead to being more happy in your life, so is a beneficial concept for everyone.</center></p>
    <h7><center>Three Steps of Emotional Intelligence</center></h7>
    <p><center>There are three main steps of Emotional Intelligence. These are:

        1. Attention training - Paying attention to what is happening within the body helps with a deeper understanding of emotion. We can train our attention to be more aware of our mind, body and emotions. This training can help maintaining a calm and clear mind, resulting in more efficent work.
        2. Self-Knowledge and Self-Mastery - With an attentive mind, we are able to pay closer attention to what is going on with us internally. With a deeper understanding of how we operate within our own bodies and minds, we become more knowledgeable of who we are, and can use this knowledge to determine the best way for us to work under certain situations. Once we have aquired this knowledge, we are able to master it, and learn steps for how to operate best under certain situations.
        3. Creating Useful Mental Habits - We can mental habits for ourselves to deal with certain situations in a more effective way. Such as learning to deal with our more critical aspects of our own mind. Any time we get frustrated and tell ourselves that the task we are doing is impossible, we can train our mind to be able to deal with this in the most effective way, rather than just allowing these more negative thoughts to win.</center></p>
