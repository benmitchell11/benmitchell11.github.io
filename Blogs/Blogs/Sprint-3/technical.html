    <h5><center>Analogy for HTML and CSS</center></h1>
    <p><center>HTML is like a blank shirt. It p-rovides you with the basic neccessities, which is just a shirt to wear as clothes. CSS would be the design on the shirt, like a logo or picture, which gives the shirt more style.</center></p>
    <h6><center>Control Flow and Loops</center></h2>
    <p><center>In javscript the control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements that are written in the script. This works in the same way as we would interpret writing as humans, because if reading any passage of writing, we would read what comes first as the order of events being explained will always go from start to finish. Loops allow for us to command the machine to do a number of processes without having to rewrite the code over and over again, and allow us to put in perimieters for these commands, like where to stop, or to skip a certain number or object. Its sort of like setting an alarm for your work week, where you set your alarm to go off every morning at 8am Monday to Friday, but when Saturday and Sunday come around the loop pauses as these are your days off. Once Monday comes again then the loop starts itself back up.</center></p>
    <h7><center>What is the DOM</center></h3>
    <p><center>The DOM, which stands for Document object model, is a programing interface that we use for HTML documents. It allows different programming languages a connection to the page so that things like the structure, style and content can be altered. Web pages are documents that can be displayed as a page on the browser, or as the HTML source, but is still the same document in both cases. We can use javascript to manipultae the dom to make our web pages interact the way we want them to.</center></p>
    <h8><center>Accessing Data From Arrays or Objects</center></h4>
    <p><center>Objects in Javascript represent a "thing" or variable in our code. This can be anything, like a car, person or building that is defined by a set of characteristics. Arrays are used when we want to create or store multiple items in a single variable. This is useful when creating an ordered collection of items, where they can be accessed by their numbered position on that list. An object would be good for setting up a specific character like a video game protaganist, where as an array would be useful if you were defining several locations to use as a vaction spot.</center></p>
    <h9><center>Functions</center></h5>
    <p><center>A function in javascript is a block of code that is designed to execute a specific task. They come in handy when you are trying to avoid repetition within your code. If you have defined a function within your code already, anytime you need to reuse that function, you can use the function you have already defined to repeat the task.</center></p>
